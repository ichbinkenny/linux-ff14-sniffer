* Sharlayan C tasks
** DONE perform successful packet capture using libpcap [2/2]
*** [X] pcap device open
*** [X] pcap device packet retrieved

** DONE Use pcap_loop and callbacks to get packets while performing other work.
* FFXIV Sniffer Class tasks
** TODO Create full struct [4/5]
*** [X] Add buffer for pcap messages that fills in a callback
*** [X] Store pcap callback function for specific packet manipulation.
*** [X] Abstract pcap initialization and sniffing start
*** [X] Allow a field to specify specific device by name, use first one otherwise.
*** [ ] Unit tests?

* TODO Grab all Opcodes from packet and classify [1/2]
** [ ] grab complete set of Opcodes.
** [X] provide nice interface for classified packets.

* DONE Create subscriber interface that allows new subscriber objects to listen to specific events. [3/3]
** [X] create subscriber class
** [X] Create subscriber example for a universal event
** [X] allow sniffer to populate fields alerting subscribers that want to know about a current packet
*** I.E. if a subscriber wants to know about a movement event, anytime the sniffer detects a movements event should trigger the subscriber's code handler.

* TODO write README.md to explain basic use of FFXIV sniffer with examples.
* TODO make opcodes work with FFXIVEventCodes to allow a cleaner, and more understandable interface.
